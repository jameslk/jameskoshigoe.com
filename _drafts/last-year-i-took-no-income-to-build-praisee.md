Nearly a year ago, I quit contracting to work on my own company. Over that time, I’ve lived off my savings, money that I have been saving for years, draining tens of thousands of dollars just to build a startup named Praisee. It’s been a journey that has taught me tremendously about what it takes to run a tech startup. And through that process I’ve learned a few important lessons.

For the longest time, I've been looking for a place where I could research things before I bought them. When I buy something, I want to know I've made the best choice possible.
